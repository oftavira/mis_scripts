A promising, yet challenging, application involves the use of colloidal NCs as light absorbers and electrocatalysts for water splitting. In this review we discuss how the tunability of these materials is ideal to understand the complex phenomena behind storing energy in chemical bonds and to optimize performance through structural and compositional modification. First, we describe the colloidal synthesis method as a means to achieve a high degree of control over single material NCs and NC heterostructures, including examples of the role of the ligands in modulating size and shape. Next, we focus on the use of NCs as light absorbers and catalysts to drive both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), together with some of the challenges related to the use of colloidal NCs as model systems and/or technological solution in water splitting. We conclude with a broader prospective on the use of colloidal chemistry for new material discovery.\n"

Herein, we report that ZnTe films with polycrystalline structures show OTS behavior. Nearly stoichiometric ZnTe thin films were deposited by an RF sputtering method. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the films were polycrystalline. The optical band gaps of the ZnTe films were estimated as 2.2 eV from UV–visible spectroscopy transmittance measurements. Photoluminescence measurements indicated the existence of deep-level defects in the ZnTe thin films. Although these ZnTe films have a polycrystalline structure with a relatively high band gap, I–V profiles show OTS characteristics, with a selectivity of over 104, fast threshold switching time in the sub-10 ns scale, and thermal stability up to 400 °C. ZnTe also shows switching endurance for more than 109 cycles without Vth drift, maintaining its selectivity of 104. Thus, we improved the threshold switching characteristics by using a wide band-gap and polycrystalline-structured ZnTe-based chalcogenide material. Post-annealing experiments indicated that the thermal budget of the ZnTe thin film was sufficient for stacked cross-point array structures, thereby overcoming a previous limitation of chalcogenide switching materials. This material is promising for application in high-density cross-point memory arrays as the selection device.',\n  'https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/aafe13',\n  ' Nanotechnology',\n  ['Taeho Kim', 'Youngjae Kim', 'Ingwan Lee', 'Dayoon Lee', 'Hyunchul Sohn'],\n  2019],\n [' Evaluation of Epitaxial ZnTe Films Prepared by RF Sputtering by Means of Ion Beam Channeling',\n  ' \\n Epitaxial films of Zinc telluride are deposited by rf sputtering on the clean surface of GaAs(100), InP(100) and GaSb(100) substrates, which have lattice mismatches with ZnTe of 7.6, 3.8 and 0.1%, respectively. Ion-channeling measurements are carried out to evaluate the crystalline quality of the ZnTe films. The defect density in the films greatly depends on the lattice mismatch between ZnTe and the substrates. The epitaxial films with thicknesses of 130 to 150 nm on GaAs, InP and GaSb give minimum aligned yields Xmin of 32, 18 and 8%, respectively. The value of Xmin of the film on GaSb is fairly small, comparable to the value for the single crystal. The dependences of the dechanneling probability on the incident-beam energy indicate the presence of dislocation lines. \\n ',\n  'https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.29.1039',\n  ' Jpn. J. Appl.

The contact resistance of the ITO–ZnO/n-ZnO contact system was optimized by a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) treatment. Through x-ray diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy depth profile measurements, the achievement on the ohmic contact of the ITO–ZnO/n-ZnO contact system was attributed to the outdiffusion of the oxygen atoms at the n-type ZnO layer surface, which was favourable for the increase of the electron carriers. By contrast, the mechanism responsible for the degradation of the contact resistance was due to the significant outdiffusion of the zinc atoms at the n-type ZnO layer surface, which also resulted in the marked peak shift of the Zn2In2O5 phase. The resulting n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction light-emitting diode fabrication, which used the transparent ITO–ZnO/n-ZnO ohmic contact system, exhibited rectifying behaviour and emitted a near-ultraviolet radiation at approximately 410\\xa0nm.',\n  'https://doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727/46/31/315102',\n  ' J.

Even with such low doping level, the pattern formation dynamics differs between both materials and, in general, CZT surfaces roughen more easily than CT. In addition, an orthogonal ripple mode develops for extended irradiation, which is more prominent in CZT crystals. Spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals that the C(Z)T crystals have a high radiation hardness since ion bombardment does not induce an amorphized surface layer. This fact also implies that the nanostructured surfaces have significant photoluminescence response, one to two orders of magnitude larger than from as-prepared crystals. These results show that large-area (~cm2) surface nanostructuring by ion beams can be implemented in the fabrication of future C(Z)T-based devices.',\n  'https://doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727/46/45/455302',\n  ' J.

Dysprosium was galvanostatically electroplated on Nd-Fe-B sintered magnets that were previously electrochemically coated with copper. Electroplated dysprosium films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, depth profiling, scanning electron micrographs, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. XPS analysis after argon ion sputtering indicates that minor impurities are only superficial as their atomic fractions in the sample nearly disappear with increasing etching time.

The influence of different CdTe-NPs deposition time (5, 20, 40 and 60\\u2009min) on the physical properties of core–shell heterostructures were investigated. In order to achieve the highest coverage level and a wide range of optical absorption at a visible range for a ZnO-NWs/CdTe-NPs (60\\u2009min) array, FTO/ZnO-NWs/CdTe-NPs (60\\u2009min)/Ni/Au core–shell solar cells were used. Solar cell fabrication was performed by soaking the samples in a saturated CdCl2 solution in methanol and a post-annealing treatment at 400 °C for 1\\u2009h in air which led to grain growth, the passivation of deep level defects, and the decrease of stacking faults. Short-circuit current and power conversion efficiency of the fabricated cell under illumination with visible light AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) were 13.3 mA cm−2 and 3.41%, respectively. It was found that introducing a thin interfacial layer of CdSe to the configuration (FTO/ZnO-NWs/CdSe (10\\u2009nm)/CdTe-NPs (60\\u2009min)/Ni/Au) led to a 5.58% enhancement of photovoltaic performance of the solar cell (20.9 mA cm−2), which is 63.6% more than that of the same configuration without CdSe.',\n  'https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/aaa9ff',\n  ' J.

     "text": "Chalcogenide materials of the amorphous phase with low band gaps were reported to show Ovonic threshold switching (OTS), making them suitable for selection devices in cross-point memory arrays. Herein, we report that ZnTe films with polycrystalline structures show OTS behavior. Nearly stoichiometric ZnTe thin films were deposited by an RF sputtering method. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the films were polycrystalline. The optical band gaps of the ZnTe films were estimated as 2.2 eV from UV–visible spectroscopy transmittance measurements. Photoluminescence measurements indicated the existence of deep-level defects in the ZnTe thin films. Although these ZnTe films have a polycrystalline structure with a relatively high band gap, I–V profiles show OTS characteristics, with a selectivity of over 104, fast threshold switching time in the sub-10 ns scale, and thermal stability up to 400 °C. ZnTe also shows switching endurance for more than 109 cycles without Vth drift, maintaining its selectivity of 104.

     "text": "Chalcogenide materials of the amorphous phase with low band gaps were reported to show Ovonic threshold switching (OTS), making them suitable for selection devices in cross-point memory arrays. Herein, we report that ZnTe films with polycrystalline structures show OTS behavior. Nearly stoichiometric ZnTe thin films were deposited by an RF sputtering method. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the films were polycrystalline. The optical band gaps of the ZnTe films were estimated as 2.2 eV from UV–visible spectroscopy transmittance measurements. Photoluminescence measurements indicated the existence of deep-level defects in the ZnTe thin films. Although these ZnTe films have a polycrystalline structure with a relatively high band gap, I–V profiles show OTS characteristics, with a selectivity of over 104, fast threshold switching time in the sub-10 ns scale, and thermal stability up to 400 °C. ZnTe also shows switching endurance for more than 109 cycles without Vth drift, maintaining its selectivity of 104. Thus, we improved the threshold switching characteristics by using a wide band-gap and polycrystalline-structured ZnTe-based chalcogenide material.

ZnTe and Cu2Te were used as targets and the shots ratio were varied to obtain 0.61, 1.47, 1.72, and 3.46% Cu concentration. Doping of ZnTe films with Cu was performed with the purpose of increasing the p-type carrier concentration and establishing the effect of concentration of Cu on structural, optical, and electrical properties of ZnTe thin films to consider their potential application in electronic devices. According to X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, and Hall effect results, ZnTe and ZnTe:Cu films correspond to polycrystalline zinc–blende phase with preferential orientation in (111) plane. Optical characterization results indicate that as-deposited films (band gap = 2.16 eV) exhibit a band gap decrease as function of the increase of Cu concentration (2.09–1.64 eV), while, annealed films exhibit a decrease from 1.75 to 1.46 eV, as the Cu concentration increases. Lastly, Hall effect results show that ZnTe films correspond to a p-type semiconductor with a carrier concentration of 3 × 1013 cm−3 and a resistivity of 1.64 × 105 Ω∙cm. ZnTe:Cu films remain like a p-type material and present an increasing carrier concentration (from 3.8 × 1015 to 1.26 × 1019 cm−3) as function of Cu concentration and a decreasing resistivity (from 7.01 × 103 to 2.6 × 10−1 Ω cm).

The effects of the CdTe shell thickness on the absorption of ZnO/CdTe NW arrays are revealed through the study of two optical key modes: the first one is confining the light into individual NWs, the second one is strongly interacting with the NW arrangement. It is also shown that the reflectivity of the substrate can improve Fabry–Perot resonances within the NWs: the ideal short-circuit current density is increased by 10% for the ZnO/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/ideal reflector as compared to the ZnO/FTO/glass substrate. Furthermore, the optimized square arrangement absorbs light more efficiently than both optimized hexagonal and triangular arrangements.

The position of the Fröhlich mode is found to be identical in porous samples with different diameters of pores and skeleton wall thicknesses, in accordance with the effective medium theory when applied to porous materials with identical semiconductor skeleton relative volume concentration.

The hardness and elastic modulus of three kinds of CdZnTe single crystals decrease with the increase of indentation load. When the nanoindenter departs the surface of the crystals, the adherence effects are obvious for the three kinds of single crystals. This is attributed to the plastic sticking behavior of CdZnTe material at a nanoscale level. When the indentation load of the three kinds of CdZnTe single crystals is in the range of 4000–12 000 µN, the adhered CdZnTe material on the nanoindenter falls onto the surface and accumulates around the nanoindentation.',\n  'https://doi.org/10.1088/0268-1242/23/10/105023',\n  ' Semicond.

In this paper, thin layers of heterogeneous colloidal compound semiconductor nanocrystals will be discussed. We will focus on the synthesis of dense packed thin buried layers of CdSe nanocrystals in thermally grown SiO2 on Si. For colloidal semiconductor nanoparticles, the influence of surfaces and interfaces on the optical and electronic transport properties is dramatically increased as compared to the corresponding homogeneous bulk materials. A combinatorial materials synthesis approach is applied to generate materials libraries by sequential ion implantation of Cd+ and Se+ by using moving spatially selective shields inserted into the beam line. It allows us to probe a wide range of chemical compositions, and thus to study the interface structure and composition between the nanoparticles and the surrounding matrix. The chemical composition and elemental redistribution driven by diffusion, nucleation and growth process will be studied and quantified by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Reaching the SiO2/Si interface CdSe and Cd accumulate and forms nanoclusters in proximity to the Si substrate inside the SiO2 layer. Although a mono-modal size distribution cannot be achieved, multi-modal size distributions and structure formation are found. This has consequences on out-diffusion, so that large particles near the surface dissolve, removing equivalent amounts of implanted material. These findings correlate well with photoluminescence (PL) measurements and lead to the conclusion that very efficient PL is mainly caused by larger precipitates. This explains the missing or suppressed blue-shift of the PL spectra despite the existence of sufficiently small CdSe clusters (<5 nm).',\n  'https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-0233/16/1/005',\n  ' Meas.

The electrical connectivity between individual nanotubes assessed from the terahertz spectra qualitatively correlates with the geometry observed in SEM images.
